                        was labeled as one of the more difficult ones to make, so I made it! The game runs in the
                        console and uses a quasi-AI (random number generation and decision trees influenced by data)
                        for the computer to make informed decisions. There are definitely some things I would change with my current knowledge, but I am still proud with how it turned out!

                        This project was created for my grade 12 physics (SPH4U) class. We had to create something that demonstrated the laws of physics,
                        all of the other groups opted for a physical implementation of these requirements, but I thought it would cool to make a game! It's called

                        Extreme Barbie Car Racing was probably the game I wrote the least code for. Unity has been something I enjoy tinkering with for years now,
                        and I have made character controllers, combat systems, implemented basic AI, and made item management systems. The only thing stopping me from publishing
                        these projects has been the 3D modelling and art side of things, although I may publish all the code for these mini-projects in the future.
