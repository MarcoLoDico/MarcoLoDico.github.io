# Personal Website

Live at https://marcolodico.github.io/

Note: This website's information is out of date, as it was completed in early 2024.

Addiitonal features I want to add:
- Media Queries: Currently the website is not made for phones. I want to fix this.
- Refactoring: I believe there is repetative CSS stlying because different sections have different class names, even if they should just display the information in the same format as another section.

This is my personal website, which I made to learn react.
